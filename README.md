# Let Me Afk 

***This mod is still WIP!***

Let Me Afk allows you to enter AFK mode, in which you are completely invulnerable. It also allows other players to sleep without AFK players.

AFK is turned off as soon as the player moves or interacts with anything.

> The code contains a lot of failed attempts at disabling pushing the player. I still have no idea how to do it.

## How to install
*TODO: Maybe after I actually finish it*

## How to use

Type `/afk` to enter AFK mode
